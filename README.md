# Heal Box Vanilla

ADDON DOCUMENTATION · VERSION 1.4.2 · World of Warcraft CLIENT 1.12.1

Party, pet and self heal display with quick-cast buttons for healers. One name plate with a health bar per group slot, plus one for every pet in the group directly below its owner, and next to it up to ten freely assignable spell buttons. A thin mana bar sits inside the health bar for everyone who actually uses mana. On top of that a complete heal prediction (direct heals, remaining HoT ticks and absorb shields) that corrects itself from the combat log and shares its numbers with other healers in the HealComm format. The interface is available in **English and German**, switchable in the options window.

**The short version:** click the minimap button (or type `/fbp config`) → options window → pick a spell for each button → done. Everything else happens on its own. `/fbp` tells you at any time what the prediction currently believes. **New in 1.4.1:** tick *Test mode* to fill the display with ghost players and arrange everything without a group.

## Installation

Download zip, unpack into your Addons folder.

The folder under `Interface\\AddOns` is called **`FBHealBox`** and holds seven files:

|File|Contents|
|-|-|
|`FBHealBox.toc`|Metadata, load order, saved variables|
|`FBHealBox.lua`|The core: party and pet display, prediction, HealComm, options|
|`FBHealBox_Raid.lua`|The raid mode module (see [Raid mode](#raid-mode)). Remove it from the `.toc` and the core runs exactly as in 1.4.1|
|`FBHealBox_Ticker.lua`|The mana ticker module (see [Mana ticker](#mana-ticker)), also removable|
|`FBHealBox_Damage.lua`|The Smart Damage module (see [Smart Damage](#smart-damage)), also removable|
|`FBHealBox.xml`|Only the event frame that calls `FBHealBox\_OnLoad` and `FBHealBox\_OnEvent`|
|`CHANGELOG.md`|What changed in which version|

The folder name must match the name of the `.toc` file, otherwise the addon never starts. If you want to rename the folder, also change the `FBADDON\_FOLDER` constant near the top of `FBHealBox.lua`, because the `ADDON\_LOADED` check depends on it. The display name lives separately in `FBADDON\_NAME` and can be changed freely.

**Optional: SuperWoW.** When detected, the addon prints `\[SuperWoW detected]` at login and casts directly on the group member without touching your current target. Without SuperWoW it briefly switches target for the cast and restores the previous one afterwards.

**No libraries required.** No Ace, no HealComm, no RosterLib. The addon speaks the HealComm protocol directly, see [HealComm sync](#healcomm-sync).

\---

## The display

Ten name plates in two families. `FBHealBox1` is always the player, `FBHealBox2` through `FBHealBox5` are `party1` through `party4`. `FBHealBoxPet1` through `FBHealBoxPet5` are the matching pets (`pet`, `partypet1` through `partypet4`). Each shows name, health percentage and a layered bar. **To move them:** hold **Shift** and drag any plate with the left mouse button, the others are anchored to it and follow. The position is saved per character and survives a reload; changing the scale does not move the plate.

Plates are stacked in the order **owner, then that owner's pet**: you, your pet, party1, party1's pet, and so on. Slots without a unit collapse, so a group with a single hunter shows six plates, not ten. The gap between plates is the *Row spacing* option.

### Clicking a plate

A **left click** on a name or health bar targets that unit; so does a **right click**. Both are configurable on the *General* tab (*Left click on plate* / *Right click on plate*): **Target**, **Unit menu** (Blizzard's own unit menu with whisper, invite, promote, leave, for players and your own pet; group pets fall back to targeting), **Move display** (drag without holding Shift) or **Nothing**. Shift + left drag always moves the display, whatever is set. In test mode clicks on ghosts only print a note.

### Who is being attacked

If your current hostile target is targeting a group member, that member's plate (and raid cell) gets a **red border**, refreshed five times a second from `targettarget`. Red takes precedence over the orange buff-watch border. Option *Mark who is attacked*.

### Line of sight

While a unit is out of your line of sight an **eye badge** (`FBLOS\_ICON`, the Blind icon) sits on the top-left corner of its plate. Vanilla has no API for this, so two paths are used: with the **UnitXP SP3** client mod installed the addon asks `UnitXP("inSight", "player", unit)` every half second, live and exact. Without it, the addon watches for the *not in line of sight* error after one of your heals and marks the unit you tried to heal for `FBLOS\_TIMEOUT` (8) seconds; the mark is cleared as soon as a cast on that unit starts or one of your heals or HoT ticks lands on it. `/fbp` reports which path is active. Option *Line of sight*; badge position via `FBLOS\_ICON\_X/Y`.

### Pets

Every pet in the group gets its own plate with the full set of spell buttons: heal the hunter's cat or the warlock's voidwalker with one click, exactly like a player. Pet plates appear and disappear with `UNIT_PET` (summon, dismiss, death). Three things tell them apart: they are **indented** by `FBPET\_INDENT` (12) px under their owner and narrower by the same amount so the buttons stay aligned, a **paw icon** (`FBPET\_ICON`) sits in front of the name, and the name is **light blue**. Hunter pets run on focus and warlock pets on mana, so only the latter get a mana bar. The *Show pets* option hides the whole family.

### Bar layers

Four status bars sit exactly on top of each other, ordered by fixed frame levels (`FBHealBox\_SetBarStrata`). Mana is the topmost strip, then health, opaque; the shield below it, the heal prediction at the bottom:

|Layer|Colour|Meaning|
|-|-|-|
|Mana|blue, 5 px along the bottom edge|Current mana, a bar inside the bar. Only for units whose power type is mana|
|Health|green / yellow / red, opaque|Current HP. Green above 60 %, yellow 30 to 60 %, red below|
|Shield|light blue, 50 %|Remaining absorb, directly behind the current HP|
|Prediction|light green, 50 %|Incoming healing, behind the shield segment|

Everything is clipped at the end of the bar: a shield exceeding maximum HP stays invisible and the scale stays true to the unit's health.

### Mana bar

The mana bar is `FBMANA\_BAR\_HEIGHT` (5) pixels high and lies on the bottom edge of the health bar. Where mana is missing a darker translucent strip shows through (`FBMANA\_BG\_ALPHA`, 0.35, set to 0 for none). It only appears when the unit's **power type is mana** (`UnitPowerType() == 0`): warriors, rogues, hunter pets and druids in cat or bear form get no strip, and the health bar is visible at full height. The bar follows `UNIT\_MANA`, `UNIT\_MAXMANA` and `UNIT\_DISPLAYPOWER`. The *Mana bar* option switches it off entirely.

### Dispel colouring

If someone carries a debuff **your** class can remove, their health bar takes the debuff colour instead of the HP colour:

|Class|Types detected|
|-|-|
|Priest|Magic (blue), Disease (brown)|
|Paladin|Magic, Poison (green), Disease|
|Shaman|Poison, Disease|
|Druid|Curse (purple), Poison|

The thresholds for the HP colours are `LowHP` (0.6) and `VeryLowHP` (0.3) near the top of the file.

\---

## The spell buttons

Up to ten buttons sit next to each plate, each showing its spell's icon. A **left click** casts that spell on exactly this group member, no matter who you currently have targeted.

**Assigning by drag and drop.** Open the spellbook, drag a spell and drop it on any heal button, on a raid mini button, or on a field in the *Buttons* tab; that button number takes the spell on every plate. With the right-click spell enabled, dropping with the right mouse button, or with Shift held while dropping, fills the right-click side. Spells outside the class list (Dispel Magic, say) are accepted too and keep their icon after a reload. Vanilla has no `GetCursorInfo()`, so the addon remembers what `PickupSpell` last put on the cursor.

**Right-click spell (optional).** Each button can carry a second spell for **right click** (Flash Heal left, Greater Heal right, say), which doubles the density without adding buttons. This is off by default and is enabled only through the switch on the *Buttons* tab. When on, a second column appears in the assignment and a small icon in the bottom-right corner of every button shows its right-click spell; the tooltip lists it as well. Switching it off keeps the assignments, it just stops the buttons from reacting to right click.

**Smart Healing (off by default).** With *Smart Healing* on, a click casts the lowest rank of the assigned spell whose expected heal covers the target's missing health, minus healing already on the way, plus the *Safety margin* (default 20 %). Expected heals come from the learned values of the prediction where available, otherwise from the tooltip average. It never goes above the rank you assigned, applies to direct heals only (HoTs, shields and buffs such as Fortitude are always cast as assigned; a spell qualifies only if its tooltip describes a heal), and below 30 % health it always casts the assigned rank. Downsides: the estimate ignores crits, and with burst damage or when you want to overheal on purpose (a tank before a big hit) the lower rank can fall short. Leave it off whenever overhealing is what you want. `/fbp debug` prints every decision, `/fbp` shows the state.

**Cooldowns.** Every button shows the usual cooldown sweep for its spell. The global cooldown is not shown (`FBCD\_MIN\_DURATION`). Option *Cooldowns on buttons*.

**HoT and shield timers.** The button of a spell shows, for its unit, the remaining seconds of your own HoT (green) or shield (blue) of that spell. When Power Word: Shield is used up, the same button shows Weakened Soul in red until the target can be shielded again. The left-click spell is checked first, then the right-click spell. Only your own effects are tracked. Option *HoT and shield timers*.

**Buff icons left of the bar.** Buffs with a duration that sit on your buttons (Fortitude, Divine Spirit, Fear Ward, Inner Fire, left or right click) appear as small 8 px icons on the **outer left side** of the plate while the buff is up, stacked two high: the first at the top next to the plate, the second below it, the third at the top of the next column to the left, and so on. The icon is a **clock**: like a minute hand, it turns black and white clockwise from twelve o'clock as the time runs out. Fresh buff: fully coloured. Half the time left: right half grey. A quarter left: three quarters grey. Vanilla cannot draw a true circular sweep, so the icon is split into four quadrants; on 8 px that is the finest resolution that still reads. Elapsed quadrants are drawn dark (desaturated where the client supports it, with a dark wash `FBBUFFICON\_WASH`) on a small frame one level above the icon, so the split is visible on every client; `/fbp buffs` also prints the grey-quadrant count per icon. Hovering an icon shows the buff name and the remaining time. The remaining time is exact on yourself (buff API, re-read on every `PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED` and once a second in between, because a refresh of a running buff fires no event; a recast therefore resets the clock) and counted from your own cast on others; a buff cast by someone else stays fully coloured (time unknown). Up to six icons per plate (`FBBUFFICON\_MAX`). Option *Buff icons left of the bar*, on by default. Raid cells show the same clock icons outside their left edge at 6 px in a 3 by 4 grid (twelve slots, columns filling from the cell outward), and the grid reserves the room for them between the groups. After a `/reload` or a group change the addon scans all units once, so existing buffs show up without waiting for an aura event. `/fbp buffs` lists the tracked buffs and their state on you.

**Dead, ghost, offline.** Instead of `0 %` the bar shows *Dead*, *Ghost* or *Offline*, empty and grey, with no mana strip.

**Debuff icon.** When a unit carries a debuff your class can remove, its icon appears right of the name with the stack count (from 2 up). The health bar takes the debuff colour as before.

The icon tints to show the state:

|Icon|State|
|-|-|
|Normal|Spell is castable|
|Bluish|Not enough mana|
|Dark grey|Not castable (cooldown, missing requirement)|
|Reddish|Target out of range|

Hovering shows the full spell tooltip plus the line *Heal Box Vanilla Target: `<name>`*, so it is always clear who this button serves.

\---

## Raid mode

Raid mode is an addon within the addon: it lives in its own file `FBHealBox_Raid.lua`, hooks into the core only through `FBHealBox\_RegisterHook` and `FBHealBox\_AddOptionsTab`, and is on by default. It does nothing until it is needed: the grid appears on its own once you are in a raid with **at least 11 players** (*Raid view from N players*, adjustable from 2 to 40); smaller raids keep the party display, which shows your own subgroup. The *Raid mode* switch is only an emergency off. Everything described above keeps working unchanged.

**Installing the module:** `FBHealBox_Raid.lua` must sit next to `FBHealBox.lua`, the `.toc` must list it (the shipped `.toc` does), and the game client must be **restarted** once. A `/reload` does not pick up files newly added to a `.toc`. When the module is active, the login lines in the chat include *Raid mode module loaded*, and the options window shows a third tab.

### What it shows

Once the raid reaches the threshold, a compact **grid** appears: one **cell** per member, grouped in **blocks of five** by raid group, the blocks arranged in rows. Each cell (70 by 22 px by default) shows the name in class colour, the health bar with the same shield and incoming-heal layers as the party plates, a 3 px mana strip for mana users, the HP percentage or the missing health, dispel colouring, *Dead* / *Ghost* / *Offline* text, range fading, the line-of-sight eye and the orange buff-watch border. To the right of every cell sit up to four **mini buttons** that cast the spells of Button 1 to N from the *Buttons* tab, right-click spells included. A click on the cell itself does what *Left click on plate* / *Right click on plate* says (target by default; the unit menu comes from Blizzard's raid frame).

Group blocks are laid out with *Groups per row* (default 4): a 40-player raid is two rows of four blocks, about 570 by 270 px with two buttons per cell and the buff-icon strip. **Empty groups take no space**, so a 20-player raid is a single row. The whole grid scales independently of the party plates and remembers its position.

While the grid is shown the five party plates are hidden (option *Hide party plates in raid*), so the screen is never filled twice.

### Tab *Raid mode*

|Setting|Effect|
|-|-|
|Raid mode|Master switch (emergency off). On by default|
|Raid view from N players|Threshold for switching from the party display to the grid. Default 11, that is more than 10 players|
|Hide party plates in raid|Hide the party display while the grid is up. On|
|Group headers|Group number above each block. On|
|Mana strip|3 px mana bar in the cell. On|
|Hide empty groups|Groups without members collapse. On|
|Title bar|Thin bar above the grid to drag it by. Without it, Shift + drag any cell. On|
|Show buffs|Buff icons with clock left of each cell. Off: no icons and no reserved strip, the groups move closer together. On|
|HP text|none, percent or deficit (missing health as a negative number)|
|Raid test|Fills the grid with 20 or 40 ghosts: dead, offline, ghost, magic and disease debuffs, out of range, out of sight, missing buff, shield, incoming heal and buff icons (every third ghost, ghost 12 with twelve) are all represented. Not saved|
|Groups per row|1 to 8. Default 4|
|Raid scale|0.5 to 1.5|
|Cell width / height|50 to 120 px / 14 to 32 px|
|Buttons per unit|0 to 4 mini buttons. Default 2|
|Button size|12 to 28 px|
|Cell spacing / Group spacing|0 to 10 px / 0 to 20 px|

All raid settings live in `HealBox.Raid`. `/fbp raidtest 20`, `/fbp raidtest 40` and `/fbp raidtest off` switch the raid test from the chat line; `/fbp` reports the raid state.

### How it hooks in

The core exposes `FBHealBox\_RegisterHook(name, fn)` and runs the hooks at fixed points: `Defaults`, `SyncOptions`, `ApplyLocale`, `UpdateNames`, `RefreshAllBars`, `ButtonsChanged`, `ActiveToggle`, `Status`, `Slash`, `Loaded`, `Aggro`, `SpellTimers` and `Cooldowns`. `FBHealBox\_AddOptionsTab(labelKey)` adds a tab to the options window. The raid module registers its roster refresh on `UpdateNames`, its cell refresh on `RefreshAllBars` (so the heal prediction reaches raid cells for free), and its slash commands on `Slash`. Raid units are added to `FBPredictUnits`, which lets HoT and shield confirmation via `UNIT\_AURA` work for `raid1` to `raid40`. Pets are not shown in raid mode.

\---

## Mana ticker

The mana ticker lives in its own module `FBHealBox_Ticker.lua` and is on by default. A **spark** travels across the mana strip of your own plate (and of your own cell in the raid grid) every 2 seconds, in step with the server's mana regeneration tick. When you spend mana the spark turns **orange** and runs the five-second rule down; it reaches the end exactly when spirit regeneration resumes, which is the first tick after the five seconds, not the five seconds themselves. Casting right after the spark reaches the end wastes no regeneration.

### How it works

There is no API for this in 1.12, so the module watches `UNIT\_MANA` for the player. Mana going down starts the five-second rule. Mana going up is a tick candidate: the first one sets the 2 s grid, every later one that lands within *Tick tolerance* of the expected time re-synchronises it. Candidates outside the tolerance (Mana Spring pulses, Innervate) are ignored; only after three misses in a row is a new grid accepted. Jumps of at least 300 mana and more than four times the learned tick size (potions, runes) never count. With full mana no ticks arrive, so the grid runs on silently and the spark stays hidden until mana is missing again; it re-synchronises on the next real tick. The spark needs the mana strip (option *Mana bar*) and disappears in bear or cat form.

### Tab *Extras*, section *Mana ticker*

|Setting|Effect|
|-|-|
|Mana ticker|Master switch. On by default|
|Five-second rule|Show the orange phase after spending mana. On|
|Tick tolerance|0.1 to 0.6 s. Raise it if ticks are being missed|
|Tick offset|0.0 to 0.5 s. Runs the spark earlier to compensate latency if it arrives late compared to your mana jumps|
|Spark width|1 to 4 px|

`/fbp ticker` toggles the ticker; `/fbp` reports whether the grid is synced, the time to the next tick and a running five-second rule. Settings live in `HealBox.Ticker`. The ticker shares the *Extras* tab with Smart Damage.

\---

## Smart Damage

Rank selection for **attack spells on any action bar**, in its own module `FBHealBox_Damage.lua`, **off by default**. When you press Smite rank 4 on a Bongos or Blizzard bar (or its key binding) and rank 2 would still kill the target, rank 2 is cast instead. Never above the rank on the bar.

### How it works

Every bar and key binding ends in `UseAction(slot)`. The module hooks that function, reads the spell and rank in the slot from a tooltip scan, and decides. Damage per rank is the **minimum** damage from the spell's tooltip ("86 to 98 Holy damage"), raised by the smallest full hit you have actually landed with that rank (crits and partial resists are not counted). A rank qualifies if its minimum damage covers the target's remaining health plus the *Safety margin* (default 20 %). Macros with `/cast` are not affected.

The target's remaining health comes from the first source that answers:

|Source|When|Accuracy|
|-|-|-|
|Server|`UnitHealthMax("target")` is not 100, i.e. the server sends real values (Turtle WoW and others)|exact|
|MobHealth3|`MobHealth3:GetUnitHealth()` knows the mob|as good as that addon|
|MobInfo-2|`MobHealth_GetTargetCurHP()` knows the mob|as good as that addon|
|Own estimate|The addon has fought this mob type (name and level) before|see below|

**Own estimate.** On percent-only servers the addon learns *health points per percent* for each mob type: it adds up the damage it can see in the combat log (yours, your party's, pets') and divides by the drop in the target's percentage, but only once the drop reaches 3 % to keep the 1 % rounding out of it. Of all measurements the **highest** is kept, because damage from raid members outside your party is invisible and would otherwise pull the estimate down; erring high only costs a slightly bigger rank. The remaining health is then the upper edge of the current percent times that value. The estimate is saved per character in `HealBox.MobHP` and improves with every fight; until a type has been measured, Smart Damage leaves that target alone.

### Section *Smart Damage* on the *Extras* tab

|Setting|Effect|
|-|-|
|Smart Damage|Master switch. Off by default|
|Safety margin|0 to 50 %, default 20. Covers partial resists and estimate error|
|Target health source|Live line: which of the four sources answers for your current target|
|Spells|The attack spells found in your spellbook with their rank count|

Spells per class: Priest Smite, Holy Fire, Mind Blast; Druid Wrath, Starfire, Moonfire; Shaman Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Earth/Flame/Frost Shock; Paladin Holy Shock, Hammer of Wrath, Exorcism, Holy Wrath; Mage Fireball, Frostbolt, Fire Blast, Scorch, Pyroblast; Warlock Shadow Bolt, Searing Pain, Immolate, Soul Fire, Conflagrate; Hunter Arcane Shot, Aimed Shot (list `FBDamageSpells`). `/fbp damage` toggles, `/fbp debug` logs every decision with the health source used.

\---

## Options window

Opened through the **minimap button**:

|Input|Effect|
|-|-|
|Left click|Toggle the options window|
|Shift + left click|Show/hide the entire display|
|Hold right and drag|Move the minimap button|

The window has two tabs.

### Tab *Buttons*

**Button 1 to 10**: one row each with the *Left click* field (icon and spell name). Clicking a field opens the spell menu (see below). The assignment is saved per character.

**Right-click spell**: enables the second spell per button and reveals the *Right click* column next to the left one. Off by default.

**Show N buttons**: how many of the ten buttons actually appear (0 to 10). Assigned but hidden buttons keep their spell.

**Smart Healing / Safety margin**: see [The buttons](#the-buttons). Off by default; margin 0 to 50 %, default 20.

### Tab *General*

**Frame scale**: scales the plates from 0.6 to 1.5. Has no effect in party-frame mode.

**Button spacing**: gap between the spell buttons (and between plate and first button), 0 to 20 px. Default 2.

**Row spacing**: vertical gap between the plates, 0 to 20 px. Default 4. Together with button spacing this lets you pack the whole display much tighter.

**Default party frames**: instead of the addon's own plates, the buttons attach to Blizzard's default party frames (`PartyMemberFrameN`); pet buttons attach to `PetFrame` and `PartyMemberFrameNPetFrame`. The addon's name plates and bars are hidden; the heal prediction keeps working invisibly.

**Mana bar**: shows or hides the mana strip inside the health bar. On by default.

**Show pets**: shows or hides all pet plates. On by default.

**Debuff icon**: shows or hides the debuff icon with stack count next to the name. On by default.

**Line of sight**: shows or hides the eye badge for units out of line of sight (see [Line of sight](#line-of-sight)). On by default.

**Mark who is attacked**, **HoT and shield timers**, **Cooldowns on buttons**, **Buff icons left of the bar**: the indicators described under [The buttons](#the-buttons) and [Who is being attacked](#who-is-being-attacked). All on by default.

**Left click on plate / Right click on plate**: what a click on a name plate does: Target (default), Unit menu, Move display, Nothing. See [Clicking a plate](#clicking-a-plate).

**Test mode**: fills slots 2 to 10 with ghost players and pets so you can arrange the display without a group (see [Test mode](#test-mode)). Not saved; always off after login.

**Class colours**: colours the name on each plate in the class colour (`RAID_CLASS_COLORS` of the client, with a built-in fallback table). Pets keep their light-blue name. On by default.

**Range fading**: fades a whole plate including its buttons to 50 % (`FBRANGE\_ALPHA`) when the unit is out of range. Range is checked every half second (`FBRANGE\_INTERVAL`) with `IsSpellInRange` on your first assigned button spell; with no spell assigned, `CheckInteractDistance(4)`, that is 28 yards, is used. On by default.

**Buff watch**: a button that opens the cascading menu with your class buffs (Fortitude, Divine Spirit, Mark of the Wild, Blessings, Thorns, Earth Shield, …; only learned ones are listed). Every plate whose unit is **missing** that buff gets an **orange border**. The group version counts too (Prayer of Fortitude for Power Word: Fortitude, Gift of the Wild for Mark of the Wild, Greater Blessings for Blessings), even when cast by another healer: the check first compares buff textures with your spellbook icons and, only if that fails, reads the buff names from a tooltip scan. Checked on `UNIT\_AURA` and after every group change, so nothing runs per frame. Pick *No buff watch* to switch it off. Saved as `WatchBuff`. Pets are left out unless *Buff watch on pets* is ticked.

**Buff watch on pets**: also marks pets missing the watched buff. Off by default.

**HealComm sync**: exchanges heal information with the group, see [HealComm sync](#healcomm-sync). On by default.

**Language / Sprache**: switches between English and German. The button opens the same cascading menu as the spell picker. The change takes effect **immediately**: `FBHealBox\_ApplyLocale()` relabels the already-built interface, no `/reload` needed. On first start `GetLocale()` decides: German clients start in German, everything else in English. The choice is saved per character.

**To move the window:** drag its frame. Close it with the X in the top right, with **Escape**, or with `/fbp config`. Escape is caught by a hook on `ToggleGameMenu` (in addition to `UISpecialFrames`), so it works on clients that do not honour that list; when Blizzard's game menu is open, Escape closes that first as usual.

\---

## Test mode

Tick *Test mode* in the options, or type `/fbp test`. Your own plate stays real; every other slot is filled with a ghost: four players and three pets, so you see the full layout including pets under their owners. If you happen to be in a real group, the ghosts replace it for as long as test mode is on.

The ghosts are built to show every visual state at once:

|Ghost|Shows|
|-|-|
|Brynn|warrior: **dead**, no mana bar, **missing buff** (orange border when a buff watch is set)|
|Cerys|warlock: mana bar, an **absorb shield** segment and the **line-of-sight** badge|
|Dorn|hunter: low health (red) with **incoming healing** behind it|
|Elowen|druid: a **dispellable debuff** (the health bar takes the dispel colour of your class) and **out of range** (faded)|
|Fang, Zorbek, Bramble|pets: a focus pet without mana bar, a mana pet with one, and a pet with incoming healing and a **disease** debuff|

Their health drifts slowly up and down so you can watch the yellow and red thresholds come and go. Dorn also carries the red attacked border, sample timers on buttons 1 and 2 and **six buff icons** with different remaining times (one without a clock). Spell buttons on ghosts do nothing except print a short note; tooltips work. The ghost table is `FBTestGhosts` near the top of the file; names, values and which extras each ghost carries can be edited freely.

Test mode is meant for the addon's own plates; in party-frame mode the ghosts sit at Blizzard's (hidden) frames and are of little use.

\---

## The spell menu

A custom cascading menu, not `UIDropDownMenu`: the 1.12 implementation of the latter closes submenus as soon as the mouse brushes a neighbouring entry, and forces check marks and a click sound.

* **Level 1** lists every learned spell of your class from the spell list, each with its icon.
* **An arrow on the right** means multiple ranks exist. The submenu opens **on hover**, overlaps the parent list by two pixels and has a 14-pixel tolerance zone around it so the mouse never loses it on the way over.
* **Open stays open**: only picking a rank, opening another submenu, or clicking outside closes it. After three seconds without the mouse nearby an emergency timer fires (`FBMENU\_GRACE\_TIME`, set it to 999 to disable).
* **No spell** at the top clears the button again.

The selection is stored as the cast string `Spell(Rank N)`, exactly the form `CastSpellByName` expects, and the reason the prediction knows the precise rank.

\---

## Heal prediction

The heart of the addon. Three independent sources feed the bars.

### Direct heals

`SPELLCAST\_START` provides the spell name and the cast time in milliseconds, regardless of whether the cast came from a Heal Box button, the action bar or a macro. No hook on `CastSpellByName` is required. The preview disappears on `SPELLCAST\_STOP`, `\_FAILED` and `\_INTERRUPTED`; pushback (`SPELLCAST\_DELAYED`) extends it.

Instants deliberately get **no** prediction: the healing has landed before a bar could show it.

### Heal over time

`UnitBuff()` reports no remaining duration for other units, so the addon keeps its own books:

1. The button registers the cast including target and rank.
2. `UNIT\_AURA` confirms the application by comparing the **buff texture** with the spellbook icon (locale independent, no tooltip scan per event).
3. What is shown is `remaining ticks × healing per tick`, with the remaining ticks derived from `(expiry − GetTime()) / interval`. The bar therefore counts down tick by tick.
4. If the buff disappears early (dispel, death, overwritten), the display is gone immediately.

HoTs cast from the action bar are recognised as well, then with the highest known rank; the first combat log tick straightens the value out.

The tick interval cannot be read from the tooltip in Vanilla and therefore lives in `FBPredictTickInterval` (3 seconds by default, Lifebloom 1).

### Absorb shields

Maximum absorb from the spellbook tooltip, consumption from the combat log (`(123 absorbed)`). For `\*\_VS\_SELF\_\*` events the victim is the player, otherwise the message is searched for one of the currently shielded names.

If you absorb more than the tooltip allows (heal gear), the maximum is corrected **upwards** and remembered. That correction is one-directional and therefore safe: more than possible cannot have been absorbed.

Fully absorbed hits report no number in Vanilla. The remaining value then stands until the buff drops and the display is cleared. Likewise absorbs on group members only count as far as the combat log shows them at all; the aura check catches the drift at the end.

### Self-correction and learned values

Tooltips in 1.12 only provide base values **without** +healing, and there is no API for spell power. The combat log, on the other hand, tells the truth:

|Observation|Effect|
|-|-|
|`… gains 194 health from your Renew.`|Sets the real healing per tick for all remaining ticks|
|`Your Flash Heal heals Bob for 1240.`|Settles the estimate in (50/50 averaging)|
|`(342 absorbed)` above the maximum|Raises the assumed shield value|

All of it lands per spell **and rank** in `HealBox.PredictMemory` and survives logout.

Two safeguards keep that memory clean. **Crits are not learned**: the crit wording makes the spell name come through the pattern as "Flash Heal critically", which is in no watch list. And learning only happens with a **confirmed rank**, that is on casts through the Heal Box buttons; otherwise a rank 3 cast from the action bar would be attributed to the maximum rank and drag the prediction down. The live display still corrects itself either way; only the persistent memory is protected.

What a spell can do is decided by its own tooltip, and a spell may be several things at once. Regrowth, for instance, provides an instant portion *and* a HoT, and is treated as both.

\---

## HealComm sync

HealComm-1.0 broadcasts plain text through `SendAddonMessage` with the prefix `HealComm`. Heal Box Vanilla speaks that protocol directly, without embedding the library. Puppeteer, pfUI, Luna Unit Frames, CT\_RaidAssist and everything else HealComm-aware therefore see your announced heals, and you see theirs.

|Message|Meaning|
|-|-|
|`Heal/<target>/<amount>/<cast time ms>/`|Direct heal starts|
|`Healstop`|Cast interrupted|
|`Healdelay/<ms>/`|Pushback|
|`GrpHeal/<amount>/<ms>/<t1>/<t2>/…`|Group heal (Prayer of Healing)|
|`GrpHealstop` · `GrpHealdelay/<ms>/`|Same for group heals|
|`Renew` · `Reju` · `Regr` `/<target>/<duration>/`|HoT applied|

Messages go to the raid, otherwise to the party, otherwise nowhere. The amounts are the self-corrected combat log values, so arguably more accurate than what a real HealComm estimates with ItemBonusLib.

A few details: on a successful cast end **no** `Healstop` is sent; HealComm receivers expire the entry themselves at cast time. Prayer of Healing correctly goes out as `GrpHeal` with every target in range. And a HoT cast from the action bar is reported after the fact on the first own combat log tick, with the duration still remaining, because only "… from **your** Renew" proves that it is yours.

On receive, your own messages are filtered by sender name, and since HealComm stores incoming heals per caster nothing can double up, not even when a real HealComm is broadcasting alongside. HoT messages carry only durations and no amounts; HealComm does not count them in its own `getHeal`, and neither does this addon.

**The protocol knows nothing about absorb shields**: those stay local.

\---

## Slash commands

|Command|Effect|
|-|-|
|`/fbp`|Status report: every tooltip value read per spell (direct, HoT and shield portion, learned values in parentheses), all currently running predictions, the state of the HealComm sync and the incoming heals received|
|`/fbp debug`|Toggles live output. Reports every detected cast, every correction, every absorb and every message sent (`\[FBP>]`)|
|`/fbp reset`|Discards all learned values and re-reads the tooltips|
|`/fbp test`|Toggles test mode (same as the checkbox)|
|`/fbp config`|Opens or closes the options window (same as the minimap button)|
|`/fbp buffs`|Lists the tracked buff spells, their presence and remaining time on you, and your raw buff textures|
|`/fbp raid`|Toggles raid mode|
|`/fbp raidtest 20` · `40` · `off`|Raid test with 20 or 40 ghosts, or off|
|`/fbp ticker`|Toggles the mana ticker|
|`/fbp damage`|Toggles Smart Damage|

`/fbp` is the first place to look when something is not displayed: if a spell is not listed there, the tooltip parser did not recognise it; the display is not at fault.

\---

## Saved settings

Everything lives in the `HealBox` table, saved **per character**:

|Key|Contents|
|-|-|
|`SpellChoice\[1..10]`|Cast string per button, e.g. `Renew(Rank 10)`|
|`MaxButtons`|How many buttons are shown|

|`PlateLeft` · `PlateRight`|Click action on a plate: `target`, `menu`, `move` or `none`|
|`SmartRank` · `SmartMargin`|Smart Healing on/off (default off) and safety margin in percent|
|`Cooldowns` · `AggroMark` · `SpellTimers` · `BuffIcons`|Cooldown sweep, red border for the attacked member, HoT/shield timers, buff icons left of the bar|

|`RangeFade`|1 = fade plates out of range, 0 = off|
|`WatchBuff`|Spell name of the buff watch, or nil|
|`BuffWatchPets`|1 = buff watch also on pets, 0 = players only (default)|
|`PosX` · `PosY`|Top-left corner of the player plate in screen pixels|

|`Damage`|Sub-table with the Smart Damage settings; `MobHP` and `DmgMemory` hold the learned mob health and minimum damage values (see [Smart Damage](#smart-damage))|
|`Raid`|Sub-table with every raid-mode setting (see [Raid mode](#raid-mode)), including `PosX` / `PosY` of the grid|
|`PredictMemory`|Learned heal values per spell and rank|

Missing keys, for example in an old `HealBox` table from 1.4, are filled in by `FBHealBox\_ApplyDefaults()` on load. Test mode is deliberately **not** saved.

### Units and test mode

The display never calls `UnitExists`, `UnitName`, `UnitHealth` or `UnitMana` directly. It goes through these wrappers, which answer from `FBTestGhosts` while test mode is on and from the real API otherwise:

|Function|Returns|
|-|-|
|`FBUnitExists(unit)`|true / false|
|`FBUnitName(unit)`|Name|
|`FBUnitHealth(unit)`|`hp, hpMax` (hpMax is never 0)|

|`FBApplySpellChoice(i, castString)`|Assigns a spell to a button|
|`HealBoxButton\_OnEvent(…)`|Tints the icon by mana, cooldown and range|

### Spell menu

|Function|Purpose|
|-|-|

|`FBMenu\_SelectSpell(entry)` · `FBMenu\_ClearSpell()`|Apply a selection, or clear the button|
|`FBMenu\_CloseAll()` · `FBMenu\_IsOpen()`|Close the menu, query its state|

### Prediction: queries

The four functions that feed the bars. All of them expect a **player name**, not a unit ID:

|Function|Returns|
|-|-|
|`FBGetDirectHeal(name)`|Amount of your running direct cast|
|`FBGetHoTHeal(name)`|Sum of all your outstanding HoT ticks|
|`FBGetShield(name)`|Remaining absorb|
|`FBGetCommHeal(name)`|Healing announced by other healers|

### Prediction: internals

|Function|Purpose|
|-|-|
|`FBPredict\_GetSpellInfo(bookID, name)`|Parses the spellbook tooltip (direct / HoT / shield)|
|`FBPredict\_BuildWatch()`|Builds the watch list after every spellbook scan|
|`FBPredict\_NoteCast(castString, target)`|Registers target and rank **before** the cast|
|`FBPredict\_CastStart(spell, castMs)` · `FBPredict\_CastEnd()`|Start and end a direct heal|

|`FBPredict\_StartHoT(…)` · `FBPredict\_StartShield(…)`|Arm the tracking|
|`FBPredict\_ParseCombat(event, msg)`|Combat log evaluation|
|`FBPredict\_OnTick(…)` · `FBPredict\_OnDirectHeal(…)` · `FBPredict\_OnAbsorb(…)`|The three correction paths|

|`FBComm\_SendHealStop()` · `FBComm\_SendHealDelay(ms)`|Interrupt and pushback|
|`FBComm\_SendHoT(spell, target, dur)`|`Renew` / `Reju` / `Regr`|
|`FBComm\_OnMessage(prefix, msg, channel, sender)`|Receive and evaluate|

|`FBSetLocale(code, apply)`|Switches language and optionally relabels the interface|
|`FBDetectLocale()`|Default language from `GetLocale()`|
|`FBHealBox\_ApplyLocale()`|Relabels the already-built interface|

\---

## Troubleshooting

**A spell does not appear in the menu.** It is not in your class's spell list (`Spell.Name` near the top of the file), or not learned yet. The list can be extended freely.

**Learned absorb values are capped.** A remembered absorb larger than 1.5 times the tooltip value is treated as a counting error and dropped on load (`FBPredict\_SanitizeMemory`); values from versions before 1.4.2 that were doubled by the old double load clean themselves up this way.

**No prediction for a particular spell.** Run `/fbp`: if the spell is not among the spells read, the tooltip parser did not recognise it. Wording can differ on custom servers; the patterns all sit in `FBPredict\_GetSpellInfo`.

**Combat log corrections do not take.** The patterns are built from the client's global strings (`PERIODICAURAHEALOTHERSELF`, `HEALEDSELFOTHER`, `ABSORB\_TRAILER`) and otherwise fall back to English defaults. `/fbp debug` shows whether corrections arrive.

**Values are too low.** Before the first observed heal only the tooltip base value without +healing is available. A single cast through the buttons is enough to settle it.

**The HealComm sync seems dead.** It only sends in a party or raid; alone nothing happens. `/fbp` shows the switch state, `/fbp debug` every outgoing message.

**Numbers are off after a gear change.** They correct themselves on the next cast; `/fbp reset` forces a fresh start.

\---

## Class spells

The preset lists, freely extensible in `Spell.Name`:

|Class|Spells|
|-|-|
|Priest|Renew · Flash Heal · Lesser Heal · Heal · Greater Heal · Binding Heal · Prayer of Healing · Prayer of Mending · Circle of Healing · Power Word: Shield · Abolish Disease · Cure Disease · Dispel Magic · Power Word: Fortitude · Prayer of Fortitude · Divine Spirit · Prayer of Spirit · Shadow Protection · Prayer of Shadow Protection · Fear Ward · Power Infusion · Resurrection|
|Druid|Healing Touch · Regrowth · Rejuvenation · Swiftmend · Tranquility · Lifebloom · Abolish Poison · Cure Poison · Remove Curse · Mark of the Wild · Gift of the Wild · Thorns · Innervate · Rebirth|
|Shaman|Lesser Healing Wave · Healing Wave · Chain Heal · Earth Shield · Water Shield · Cure Poison · Cure Disease · Purge · Ancestral Spirit · Water Walking · Water Breathing|
|Paladin|Flash of Light · Holy Light · Holy Shock · Lay on Hands · Cleanse · Purify · Blessing of Protection · Blessing of Freedom · Blessing of Sacrifice · Redemption · Divine Intervention · Blessing of Wisdom / Might / Kings / Salvation / Light / Sanctuary · Greater Blessing of Wisdom / Might / Kings / Salvation / Light / Sanctuary|
|Mage|Remove Lesser Curse · Arcane Intellect · Arcane Brilliance · Dampen Magic · Amplify Magic|
|Warlock|Unending Breath · Detect Invisibility · Detect Lesser / Greater Invisibility|

Entries that do not exist do no harm: if the spellbook scan does not find them, they are quietly skipped.

## Credits

**Original: Heal Box by Dourd** (Argent Dawn EU), UI Overhauled. The core idea, the layout with name plates and quick-cast buttons and the original options window are his. Without that groundwork this addon would not exist. Credit where credit is due.

**Ported to Vanilla and extended 09/2026: Mquadrat.** Ported to client 1.12.1 with optional SuperWoW support, plus:

* a custom cascading menu for spell and rank selection, because `UIDropDownMenu` provides no usable submenus in 1.12
* heal prediction for direct heals, remaining HoT ticks and absorb shields, self-correcting from the combat log
* HealComm sync with Puppeteer, pfUI, Luna and others, without any Ace libraries
* English, German, Spanish, French and Italian localization, switchable in game
* 1.4.4.1: buff tracking & tooltip scanning fix (Divine Spirit clock icon), expanded class spell lists with blessings, buffs, utility and rez spells, group buff alternate tracking; see CHANGELOG
* 1.4.4: performance pass without functional change (central button states, display caches, shared aura scans, coalesced event bursts); see CHANGELOG
* 1.4.3: mana ticker module (2 s regeneration tick and five-second rule as a spark in the mana bar), Smart Damage module (rank selection for attack spells on any action bar), Smart Healing (auto-downrank, off by default), cooldown sweep on buttons, red border for the attacked member, HoT/shield timers on buttons
* 1.4.2: raid mode as a separate module (`FBHealBox_Raid.lua`) with a compact 20/40 grid, mini buttons, own options tab and raid test; hook interface in the core
* 1.4.1: pet plates, mana bar inside the health bar, adjustable button and row spacing, test mode with ghost players, saved plate position, class colours, buff watch, range fading, tabbed options, right-click spell, dead/ghost/offline text, debuff icon. See CHANGELOG.md.

# Heal Box Vanilla

ADDON-DOKUMENTATION · VERSION 1.4.4.1 · CLIENT 1.12.1

Party-, Begleiter- und Selbst-Heilanzeige mit Schnellzugriff-Buttons für Heiler. Für jeden Gruppenplatz eine Namensplakette mit Lebensbalken, dazu eine für jeden Begleiter in der Gruppe direkt unter seinem Besitzer, daneben bis zu zehn frei belegbare Zauber-Buttons. Ein schmaler Manabalken liegt im Lebensbalken, bei allen, die tatsächlich Mana nutzen. Dazu eine vollständige Heilvorhersage (Direktheilung, HoT-Restticks und Absorb-Schilde), die sich über den Combatlog selbst korrigiert und ihre Werte im HealComm-Format mit anderen Heilern teilt. Die Oberfläche gibt es auf **Deutsch und Englisch**, umschaltbar im Optionsfenster.

**Kurzfassung für Ungeduldige:** Minimap-Button anklicken (oder `/fbp config`) → Optionsfenster → für jeden Button einen Zauber wählen → fertig. Alles Weitere passiert von allein. `/fbp` zeigt jederzeit, was die Vorhersage gerade denkt. **Neu in 1.4.1:** *Testmodus* anhaken, dann füllt sich die Anzeige mit Geisterspielern und du kannst alles ohne Gruppe einrichten.

\---

## Installation

Der Ordner unter `Interface\\AddOns` heißt **`FBHealBox`** und enthält sieben Dateien:

|Datei|Inhalt|
|-|-|
|`FBHealBox.toc`|Metadaten, Ladereihenfolge, SavedVariables|
|`FBHealBox.lua`|Der Kern: Gruppen- und Begleiteranzeige, Vorhersage, HealComm, Optionen|
|`FBHealBox_Raid.lua`|Das Raidmodus-Modul (siehe [Raidmodus](#raidmodus)). Aus der `.toc` entfernt, läuft der Kern genau wie in 1.4.1|
|`FBHealBox_Ticker.lua`|Das Mana-Ticker-Modul (siehe [Mana-Ticker](#mana-ticker)), ebenfalls entfernbar|
|`FBHealBox_Damage.lua`|Das Smart-Damage-Modul (siehe [Smart Damage](#smart-damage)), ebenfalls entfernbar|
|`FBHealBox.xml`|Nur der Event-Frame, der `FBHealBox\_OnLoad` und `FBHealBox\_OnEvent` aufruft|
|`CHANGELOG.md`|Was sich in welcher Version geaendert hat|

Der Ordnername muss zum Dateinamen der `.toc` passen, sonst startet das Addon nicht. Willst du den Ordner umbenennen, ändere in `FBHealBox.lua` zusätzlich die Konstante `FBADDON\_FOLDER` am Dateianfang, denn daran hängt der `ADDON\_LOADED`-Abgleich. Der Anzeigename steht getrennt davon in `FBADDON\_NAME` und darf frei geändert werden.

**Optional: SuperWoW.** Wird es erkannt, meldet das Addon beim Login `\[SuperWoW erkannt]` und castet direkt auf das Gruppenmitglied, ohne dein aktuelles Ziel anzufassen. Ohne SuperWoW wechselt das Addon für den Cast kurz das Ziel und stellt das alte danach wieder her.

**Keine Bibliotheken nötig.** Kein Ace, kein HealComm, kein RosterLib. Das Addon spricht das HealComm-Protokoll direkt, siehe [HealComm-Sync](#healcomm-sync).

\---

## Die Anzeige

Zehn Namensplaketten in zwei Familien. `FBHealBox1` ist immer der Spieler selbst, `FBHealBox2` bis `FBHealBox5` sind `party1` bis `party4`. `FBHealBoxPet1` bis `FBHealBoxPet5` sind die zugehörigen Begleiter (`pet`, `partypet1` bis `partypet4`). Jede zeigt Name, Lebensprozent und einen mehrschichtigen Balken. **Verschieben:** mit gehaltener **Shift**-Taste eine beliebige Plakette mit der linken Maustaste ziehen, die anderen hängen daran und folgen. Die Position wird pro Charakter gespeichert und übersteht den Reload; ein Wechsel der Skalierung verschiebt die Platte nicht.

Gestapelt wird in der Reihenfolge **Besitzer, darunter sein Begleiter**: du, dein Pet, party1, das Pet von party1 und so weiter. Leere Plätze fallen weg: Eine Gruppe mit einem einzigen Jäger zeigt sechs Plaketten, nicht zehn. Der Abstand zwischen den Plaketten ist die Option *Zeilen-Abstand*.

### Klick auf eine Plakette

Ein **Linksklick** auf Name oder Lebensbalken visiert die Einheit an; ein **Rechtsklick** ebenfalls. Beides ist im Reiter *Allgemein* belegbar (*Linksklick auf Plakette* / *Rechtsklick auf Plakette*): **Anvisieren**, **Einheitenmenü** (Blizzards eigenes Menü mit Flüstern, Einladen, Befördern, Verlassen, für Spieler und den eigenen Begleiter; Gruppen-Begleiter fallen auf Anvisieren zurück), **Anzeige verschieben** (Ziehen ohne Shift) oder **Nichts**. Shift + Linksklick ziehen verschiebt die Anzeige immer, egal was eingestellt ist. Im Testmodus geben Klicks auf Geister nur eine Chatmeldung.

### Wer wird angegriffen

Hat dein aktuelles feindliches Ziel ein Gruppenmitglied im Ziel, bekommt dessen Plakette (und Raid-Zelle) einen **roten Rahmen**, fünfmal je Sekunde aus `targettarget` aufgefrischt. Rot hat Vorrang vor dem orangen Buff-Wache-Rahmen. Option *Angegriffenen markieren*.

### Sichtlinie

Solange eine Einheit außerhalb deiner Sichtlinie ist, sitzt ein **Augen-Abzeichen** (`FBLOS\_ICON`, das Blenden-Icon) auf der linken oberen Ecke ihrer Plakette. Vanilla hat dafür keine API, deshalb zwei Wege: Ist der Client-Mod **UnitXP SP3** installiert, fragt das Addon alle halbe Sekunde `UnitXP("inSight", "player", unit)` ab, live und exakt. Ohne ihn achtet das Addon auf die Fehlermeldung *nicht in Sichtlinie* nach einer eigenen Heilung und markiert die Einheit, die du heilen wolltest, für `FBLOS\_TIMEOUT` (8) Sekunden; die Markierung verschwindet, sobald ein Cast auf sie startet oder eine eigene Heilung bzw. ein HoT-Tick dort ankommt. `/fbp` zeigt, welcher Weg aktiv ist. Option *Sichtlinie*; Position des Abzeichens über `FBLOS\_ICON\_X/Y`.

### Begleiter

Jeder Begleiter in der Gruppe bekommt eine eigene Plakette mit dem vollen Satz Zauber-Buttons: die Katze des Jägers oder den Leerwandler des Hexers heilt man mit einem Klick, genau wie einen Spieler. Pet-Plaketten kommen und gehen mit `UNIT\_PET` (Beschwören, Wegschicken, Tod). Drei Merkmale unterscheiden sie: Sie sind unter ihrem Besitzer um `FBPET\_INDENT` (12) px **eingerückt** und um denselben Betrag schmaler, damit die Buttons bündig bleiben, ein **Pfoten-Icon** (`FBPET\_ICON`) steht vor dem Namen, und der Name ist **hellblau**. Jägerbegleiter laufen auf Fokus, Hexerbegleiter auf Mana; nur letztere bekommen einen Manabalken. Die Option *Begleiter anzeigen* blendet die ganze Familie aus.

### Balkenaufbau

Vier Statusbalken liegen deckungsgleich übereinander, geregelt über feste Ebenen (`FBHealBox\_SetBarStrata`). Ganz oben der schmale Manastreifen, dann der Lebensbalken, deckend; darunter der Schild, ganz unten die Heilvorhersage:

|Schicht|Farbe|Bedeutung|
|-|-|-|
|Mana|blau, 5 px am unteren Rand|Aktuelles Mana, Balken im Balken. Nur bei Einheiten mit Powertyp Mana|
|Leben|grün / gelb / rot, deckend|Aktuelle HP. Grün über 60 %, gelb 30 bis 60 %, rot darunter|
|Schild|hellblau, 50 %|Verbleibender Absorb, direkt hinter den aktuellen HP|
|Vorhersage|hellgrün, 50 %|Eingehende Heilung, hinter dem Schild-Anteil|

Alles wird am Balkenende abgeschnitten: Ein Schild über der Maximal-HP bleibt unsichtbar, die Skala bleibt maßstabsgetreu.

### Manabalken

Der Manabalken ist `FBMANA\_BAR\_HEIGHT` (5) Pixel hoch und liegt auf der Unterkante des Lebensbalkens. Wo Mana fehlt, scheint ein dunkler, halbtransparenter Streifen durch (`FBMANA\_BG\_ALPHA`, 0.35, auf 0 setzen, wenn unerwünscht). Er erscheint nur, wenn der **Powertyp der Einheit Mana** ist (`UnitPowerType() == 0`): Krieger, Schurken, Jägerbegleiter und Druiden in Katzen- oder Bärengestalt bekommen keinen Streifen, der Lebensbalken ist dann auf voller Höhe zu sehen. Der Balken folgt `UNIT\_MANA`, `UNIT\_MAXMANA` und `UNIT\_DISPLAYPOWER`. Die Option *Manabalken* schaltet ihn ganz ab.

### Dispel-Färbung

Hat jemand einen Debuff, den **deine** Klasse entfernen kann, färbt sich sein Lebensbalken in der Debuff-Farbe statt nach HP-Stand:

|Klasse|Erkannte Typen|
|-|-|
|Priester|Magie (blau), Krankheit (braun)|
|Paladin|Magie, Gift (grün), Krankheit|
|Schamane|Gift, Krankheit|
|Druide|Fluch (violett), Gift|

Die Schwellwerte für die HP-Farben stehen als `LowHP` (0.6) und `VeryLowHP` (0.3) am Dateianfang.

## Die Zauber-Buttons

Rechts neben jeder Plakette liegen bis zu zehn Buttons, jeder mit dem Icon seines Zaubers. Ein **Linksklick** wirkt den Zauber auf genau dieses Gruppenmitglied, unabhängig davon, wen du gerade im Ziel hast.

**Belegen per Drag & Drop.** Zauberbuch öffnen, einen Zauber ziehen und auf einen beliebigen Heil-Button, einen Raid-Mini-Button oder ein Feld im Reiter *Buttons* fallen lassen; diese Buttonnummer übernimmt den Zauber auf allen Plaketten. Ist der Rechtsklick-Zauber aktiv, füllt ein Ablegen mit der rechten Maustaste oder mit gehaltener Shift-Taste die Rechtsklick-Seite. Auch Zauber außerhalb der Klassenliste (etwa Magie bannen) werden angenommen und behalten ihr Icon über einen Reload. Vanilla hat kein `GetCursorInfo()`, deshalb merkt sich das Addon, was `PickupSpell` zuletzt an den Cursor gehängt hat.

**Rechtsklick-Zauber (optional).** Jeder Button kann einen zweiten Zauber für **Rechtsklick** tragen (etwa Blitzheilung links, Große Heilung rechts), was die Anzeige verdichtet, ohne Buttons hinzuzufügen. Das ist standardmäßig aus und wird ausschließlich über den Schalter im Reiter *Buttons* eingeschaltet. Eingeschaltet erscheint eine zweite Spalte in der Belegung, und ein kleines Icon unten rechts auf jedem Button zeigt seinen Rechtsklick-Zauber; der Tooltip nennt ihn ebenfalls. Ausschalten behält die Belegung, die Buttons reagieren nur nicht mehr auf Rechtsklick.

**Smart Healing (standardmäßig aus).** Mit *Smart Healing* wirkt ein Klick den niedrigsten Rang des belegten Zaubers, dessen erwartete Heilung das fehlende Leben des Ziels abzüglich schon eingehender Heilung plus *Sicherheitsaufschlag* (Standard 20 %) deckt. Die erwartete Heilung stammt aus den gelernten Werten der Vorhersage, wo vorhanden, sonst aus dem Tooltip-Mittelwert. Nie über dem belegten Rang, nur für Direktheilungen (HoTs, Schilde und Buffs wie Seelenstärke gehen immer wie belegt raus; ein Zauber kommt nur in Frage, wenn sein Tooltip eine Heilung beschreibt), und unter 30 % Leben immer der belegte Rang. Nachteile: Die Schätzung kennt keine Crits, und bei Schadensspitzen oder gewolltem Überheilen (Tank vor einem großen Treffer) kann der kleinere Rang zu wenig sein. Aus lassen, wann immer Overheal gewollt ist. `/fbp debug` zeigt jede Entscheidung, `/fbp` den Zustand.

**Cooldowns.** Jeder Button zeigt die gewohnte Cooldown-Uhr seines Zaubers. Der globale Cooldown wird nicht gezeigt (`FBCD\_MIN\_DURATION`). Option *Cooldowns auf den Buttons*.

**HoT- und Schild-Timer.** Der Button eines Zaubers zeigt für seine Einheit die Restsekunden deines eigenen HoTs (grün) oder Schilds (blau) dieses Zaubers. Ist Machtwort: Schild verbraucht, zeigt derselbe Button rot die Geschwächte Seele, bis das Ziel wieder schildbar ist. Geprüft wird zuerst der Linksklick-Zauber, dann der Rechtsklick-Zauber. Nur eigene Effekte werden verfolgt. Option *HoT- und Schild-Timer*.

**Buff-Icons links am Balken.** Buffs mit Laufzeit, die auf deinen Buttons liegen (Seelenstärke, Göttlicher Willen, Furchtzauberschutz, Inneres Feuer, links oder rechts), erscheinen als kleine 8-px-Icons **außen links** neben der Plakette, solange der Buff wirkt, in Zweierstapeln: das erste oben an der Platte, das zweite darunter, das dritte oben in der nächsten Spalte links, und so weiter. Das Icon ist eine **Uhr**: Wie ein Minutenzeiger wird es mit ablaufender Zeit im Uhrzeigersinn ab zwölf Uhr schwarz-weiß. Frischer Buff: ganz farbig. Halbe Zeit übrig: rechte Hälfte grau. Ein Viertel übrig: drei Viertel grau. Vanilla kann keinen echten Kreis-Sweep zeichnen, deshalb ist das Icon in vier Quadranten geteilt; bei 8 px ist das die feinste Auflösung, die noch lesbar ist. Abgelaufene Quadranten werden dunkel gezeichnet (entsättigt, wo der Client das kann, mit dunkler Wäsche `FBBUFFICON\_WASH`) auf einem kleinen Frame eine Ebene über dem Icon, damit die Teilung auf jedem Client sichtbar ist; `/fbp buffs` nennt außerdem je Icon die Zahl grauer Quadranten. Mouseover auf ein Icon zeigt Buffname und Restzeit. Die Restzeit ist bei dir selbst exakt (Buff-API, bei jedem `PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED` und dazwischen einmal je Sekunde neu gelesen, weil ein Refresh eines laufenden Buffs kein Event feuert; ein Neucast stellt die Uhr also zurück) und wird bei anderen ab deinem eigenen Cast gezählt; ein fremd gewirkter Buff bleibt ganz farbig (Zeit unbekannt). Bis zu sechs Icons je Plakette (`FBBUFFICON\_MAX`). Option *Buff-Icons links am Balken*, standardmäßig an. Die Raid-Zellen zeigen dieselben Uhr-Icons außen an ihrer linken Kante mit 6 px in einem 3-mal-4-Raster (zwölf Plätze, Spalten füllen sich von der Zelle nach außen), das Raster hält zwischen den Gruppen Platz dafür frei. Nach einem `/reload` oder Gruppenwechsel scannt das Addon alle Einheiten einmal aktiv, damit vorhandene Buffs sofort erscheinen und nicht erst beim nächsten Aura-Event. `/fbp buffs` listet die verfolgten Buffs und ihren Zustand auf dir.

**Tot, Geist, Offline.** Statt `0 %` zeigt der Balken *Tot*, *Geist* oder *Offline*, leer und grau, ohne Manastreifen.

**Debuff-Icon.** Trägt eine Einheit einen Debuff, den deine Klasse entfernen kann, erscheint sein Icon rechts neben dem Namen mit Stackzahl (ab 2). Der Lebensbalken nimmt wie bisher die Debuff-Farbe an.

Der Icon-Rand färbt sich mit:

|Icon|Zustand|
|-|-|
|Normal|Zauber wirkbar|
|Bläulich|Nicht genug Mana|
|Dunkelgrau|Nicht wirkbar (Cooldown, Voraussetzung fehlt)|
|Rötlich|Ziel außer Reichweite|

Beim Überfahren erscheint der komplette Zaubertooltip plus die Zeile *Heal Box Vanilla Ziel: `<Name>`*, damit klar ist, wen dieser Button bedient.

\---

## Raidmodus

Der Raidmodus ist ein Addon im Addon: Er lebt in der eigenen Datei `FBHealBox_Raid.lua`, hängt sich nur über `FBHealBox\_RegisterHook` und `FBHealBox\_AddOptionsTab` in den Kern ein und ist standardmäßig an. Er tut nichts, bis er gebraucht wird: Das Raster erscheint von selbst, sobald du in einem Schlachtzug mit **mindestens 11 Spielern** bist (*Raid-Ansicht ab N Spielern*, einstellbar von 2 bis 40); kleinere Raids behalten die Gruppenanzeige, die deine eigene Untergruppe zeigt. Der Schalter *Raidmodus* ist nur ein Notaus. Alles oben Beschriebene funktioniert unverändert weiter.

**Modul installieren:** `FBHealBox_Raid.lua` muss neben `FBHealBox.lua` liegen, die `.toc` muss sie auflisten (die mitgelieferte tut das), und der Spielclient muss einmal **neu gestartet** werden. Ein `/reload` übernimmt keine neu in eine `.toc` eingetragenen Dateien. Ist das Modul aktiv, steht beim Login *Raidmodus-Modul geladen* im Chat, und das Optionsfenster zeigt einen dritten Reiter.

### Was er zeigt

Erreicht der Raid die Schwelle, erscheint ein kompaktes **Raster**: eine **Zelle** je Mitglied, in **Fünferblöcken** nach Gruppe geordnet, die Blöcke in Zeilen. Jede Zelle (standardmäßig 70 mal 22 px) zeigt den Namen in Klassenfarbe, den Lebensbalken mit denselben Schild- und Vorhersage-Schichten wie die Plaketten, einen 3 px hohen Manastreifen bei Mana-Nutzern, die Lebensprozente oder die fehlenden Lebenspunkte, die Dispel-Färbung, *Tot* / *Geist* / *Offline*, das Reichweiten-Fading, das Sichtlinien-Auge und den orangen Buff-Wache-Rahmen. Rechts an jeder Zelle sitzen bis zu vier **Mini-Buttons**, die die Zauber von Button 1 bis N aus dem Reiter *Buttons* wirken, Rechtsklick-Zauber inklusive. Ein Klick auf die Zelle selbst tut, was *Linksklick auf Plakette* / *Rechtsklick auf Plakette* vorgibt (Standard Anvisieren; das Einheitenmenü kommt aus Blizzards Raid-Fenster).

Die Gruppenblöcke stehen mit *Gruppen je Zeile* (Standard 4) im Raster: Ein 40er-Raid sind zwei Zeilen zu vier Blöcken, etwa 570 mal 270 px bei zwei Buttons je Zelle und dem Streifen für die Buff-Icons. **Leere Gruppen brauchen keinen Platz**, ein 20er-Raid ist also eine einzige Zeile. Das ganze Raster skaliert unabhängig von den Plaketten und merkt sich seine Position.

Solange das Raster zu sehen ist, werden die fünf Gruppenplaketten ausgeblendet (Option *Gruppenplaketten im Raid ausblenden*), damit der Bildschirm nie doppelt belegt ist.

### Reiter *Raidmodus*

|Einstellung|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|Raidmodus|Hauptschalter (Notaus). Standardmäßig an|
|Raid-Ansicht ab N Spielern|Schwelle für den Wechsel von der Gruppenanzeige zum Raster. Standard 11, also mehr als 10 Spieler|
|Gruppenplaketten im Raid ausblenden|Gruppenanzeige verstecken, solange das Raster steht. An|
|Gruppenköpfe|Gruppennummer über jedem Block. An|
|Manastreifen|3 px Manabalken in der Zelle. An|
|Leere Gruppen ausblenden|Gruppen ohne Mitglieder fallen weg. An|
|Titelleiste|Schmale Leiste über dem Raster zum Ziehen. Ohne sie: Shift + eine beliebige Zelle ziehen. An|
|Buffs anzeigen|Buff-Icons mit Uhr links an jeder Zelle. Aus: keine Icons und kein reservierter Streifen, die Gruppen rücken enger zusammen. An|
|HP-Text|keiner, Prozent oder Defizit (fehlende Lebenspunkte als negative Zahl)|
|Raid-Test|Füllt das Raster mit 20 oder 40 Geistern: tot, offline, Geist, Magie- und Krankheits-Debuff, außer Reichweite, außer Sicht, fehlender Buff, Schild, eingehende Heilung und Buff-Icons (jeder dritte Geist, Geist 12 mit zwölf) sind alle vertreten. Wird nicht gespeichert|
|Gruppen je Zeile|1 bis 8. Standard 4|
|Raid-Skalierung|0.5 bis 1.5|
|Zellenbreite / -höhe|50 bis 120 px / 14 bis 32 px|
|Buttons je Einheit|0 bis 4 Mini-Buttons. Standard 2|
|Buttongröße|12 bis 28 px|
|Zellenabstand / Gruppenabstand|0 bis 10 px / 0 bis 20 px|

Alle Raid-Einstellungen liegen in `HealBox.Raid`. `/fbp raidtest 20`, `/fbp raidtest 40` und `/fbp raidtest off` schalten den Raid-Test aus der Chatzeile; `/fbp` meldet den Raid-Zustand.

### Wie er andockt

Der Kern bietet `FBHealBox\_RegisterHook(name, fn)` und ruft die Hooks an festen Stellen: `Defaults`, `SyncOptions`, `ApplyLocale`, `UpdateNames`, `RefreshAllBars`, `ButtonsChanged`, `ActiveToggle`, `Status`, `Slash`, `Loaded`, `Aggro`, `SpellTimers` und `Cooldowns`. `FBHealBox\_AddOptionsTab(labelKey)` legt einen Reiter im Optionsfenster an. Das Raid-Modul hängt sein Roster-Update an `UpdateNames`, sein Zellen-Update an `RefreshAllBars` (so erreicht die Heilvorhersage die Raid-Zellen ohne Zusatzaufwand) und seine Slash-Befehle an `Slash`. Die Raid-Einheiten werden in `FBPredictUnits` eingetragen, damit die HoT- und Schild-Bestätigung über `UNIT\_AURA` auch für `raid1` bis `raid40` greift. Begleiter werden im Raidmodus nicht angezeigt.

\---

## Mana-Ticker

Der Mana-Ticker lebt im eigenen Modul `FBHealBox_Ticker.lua` und ist standardmäßig an. Ein **Funke** wandert alle 2 Sekunden über den Manastreifen deiner eigenen Plakette (und deiner eigenen Zelle im Raid-Raster), im Takt des Regenerationsticks des Servers. Gibst du Mana aus, wird der Funke **orange** und läuft die Fünf-Sekunden-Regel herunter; er erreicht das Ende genau dann, wenn die Willenskraft-Regeneration wieder einsetzt, also am ersten Tick nach den fünf Sekunden, nicht nach den fünf Sekunden selbst. Wer direkt nach dem Funken am Ende castet, verschenkt keine Regeneration.

### Wie er arbeitet

In 1.12 gibt es dafür keine API, deshalb beobachtet das Modul `UNIT\_MANA` für den Spieler. Sinkendes Mana startet die Fünf-Sekunden-Regel. Steigendes Mana ist ein Tick-Kandidat: Der erste setzt das 2-s-Raster, jeder spätere, der innerhalb der *Tick-Toleranz* um den erwarteten Zeitpunkt liegt, synchronisiert es neu. Kandidaten außerhalb der Toleranz (Manaquelle-Pulse, Anregen) werden ignoriert; erst nach drei Fehlschlägen in Folge gilt ein neues Raster. Sprünge ab 300 Mana und mehr als dem Vierfachen der gelernten Tickgröße (Tränke, Runen) zählen nie. Bei vollem Mana kommen keine Ticks, das Raster läuft dann still weiter und der Funke bleibt ausgeblendet, bis wieder Mana fehlt; am nächsten echten Tick synchronisiert er sich neu. Der Funke braucht den Manastreifen (Option *Manabalken*) und verschwindet in Bären- oder Katzengestalt.

### Reiter *Extras*, Abschnitt *Mana-Ticker*

|Einstellung|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|Mana-Ticker|Hauptschalter. Standardmäßig an|
|Fünf-Sekunden-Regel|Orange Phase nach Manaverbrauch anzeigen. An|
|Tick-Toleranz|0.1 bis 0.6 s. Erhöhen, wenn Ticks verpasst werden|
|Tick-Vorlauf|0.0 bis 0.5 s. Lässt den Funken früher loslaufen, um Latenz auszugleichen, falls er später ankommt als deine Manasprünge|
|Funkenbreite|1 bis 4 px|

`/fbp ticker` schaltet den Ticker um; `/fbp` meldet, ob das Raster synchron ist, die Zeit bis zum nächsten Tick und eine laufende Fünf-Sekunden-Regel. Einstellungen liegen in `HealBox.Ticker`. Der Ticker teilt sich den Reiter *Extras* mit Smart Damage.

\---

## Smart Damage

Rangwahl für **Angriffszauber auf jeder Aktionsleiste**, im eigenen Modul `FBHealBox_Damage.lua`, **standardmäßig aus**. Drückst du Göttliche Pein Rang 4 auf einer Bongos- oder Blizzard-Leiste (oder deren Tastenkürzel) und Rang 2 würde das Ziel noch töten, wird Rang 2 gewirkt. Nie über dem Rang auf der Leiste.

### Wie es arbeitet

Jede Leiste und jedes Tastenkürzel endet in `UseAction(slot)`. Das Modul hängt sich davor, liest Zauber und Rang im Slot per Tooltip-Scan und entscheidet. Der Schaden je Rang ist der **Mindestschaden** aus dem Tooltip („86 to 98 Holy damage"), angehoben durch den kleinsten Volltreffer, den du mit diesem Rang tatsächlich gelandet hast (Crits und Teilwiderstände zählen nicht). Ein Rang kommt in Frage, wenn sein Mindestschaden das Restleben des Ziels plus *Sicherheitsaufschlag* (Standard 20 %) deckt. Makros mit `/cast` bleiben unberührt.

Das Restleben des Ziels liefert die erste Quelle, die antwortet:

|Quelle|Wann|Genauigkeit|
|-|-|-|
|Server|`UnitHealthMax("target")` ist nicht 100, der Server sendet also echte Werte (Turtle WoW und andere)|exakt|
|MobHealth3|`MobHealth3:GetUnitHealth()` kennt den Mob|so gut wie dieses Addon|
|MobInfo-2|`MobHealth_GetTargetCurHP()` kennt den Mob|so gut wie dieses Addon|
|Eigene Schätzung|Das Addon hat diesen Mobtyp (Name und Stufe) schon einmal bekämpft|siehe unten|

**Eigene Schätzung.** Auf reinen Prozent-Servern lernt das Addon je Mobtyp die *Lebenspunkte je Prozent*: Es summiert den Schaden, den es im Combatlog sieht (deinen, den deiner Gruppe, den der Begleiter), und teilt durch den Prozentabfall des Ziels, aber erst ab 3 % Abfall, damit die Rundung auf ganze Prozent nicht stört. Von allen Messungen bleibt die **höchste**, weil Schaden von Raidmitgliedern außerhalb deiner Gruppe unsichtbar ist und die Schätzung sonst nach unten zöge; ein zu hoher Wert kostet nur einen etwas größeren Rang. Das Restleben ist dann die Obergrenze des aktuellen Prozentwerts mal diesem Faktor. Die Schätzung wird je Charakter in `HealBox.MobHP` gespeichert und wird mit jedem Kampf besser; bis ein Typ vermessen ist, lässt Smart Damage dieses Ziel in Ruhe.

### Abschnitt *Smart Damage* im Reiter *Extras*

|Einstellung|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|Smart Damage|Hauptschalter. Standardmäßig aus|
|Sicherheitsaufschlag|0 bis 50 %, Standard 20. Deckt Teilwiderstände und Schätzfehler|
|Lebensquelle des Ziels|Livezeile: welche der vier Quellen für dein aktuelles Ziel antwortet|
|Zauber|Die im Zauberbuch gefundenen Angriffszauber mit Rangzahl|

Zauber je Klasse: Priester Göttliche Pein, Heiliges Feuer, Gedankenschlag; Druide Zorn, Sternenfeuer, Mondfeuer; Schamane Blitzschlag, Kettenblitzschlag, Erd-/Flammen-/Frostschock; Paladin Heiliger Schock, Hammer des Zorns, Exorzismus, Heiliger Zorn; Magier Feuerball, Frostblitz, Feuerschlag, Versengen, Pyroschlag; Hexenmeister Schattenblitz, Sengender Schmerz, Feuerbrand, Seelenfeuer, Feuersbrunst; Jäger Arkaner Schuss, Gezielter Schuss (Liste `FBDamageSpells`). `/fbp damage` schaltet um, `/fbp debug` protokolliert jede Entscheidung mit der genutzten Lebensquelle.

\---

## Optionsfenster

Zu öffnen über den **Minimap-Button**:

|Bedienung|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|Linksklick|Optionsfenster auf/zu|
|Shift + Linksklick|Gesamte Anzeige ein-/ausblenden|
|Rechts halten und ziehen|Minimap-Button verschieben|

Das Fenster hat zwei Reiter.

### Reiter *Buttons*

**Button 1 bis 10**: je eine Zeile mit dem Feld *Linksklick* (Icon und Zaubername). Klick auf ein Feld öffnet das Zauber-Menü (siehe unten). Die Belegung wird pro Charakter gespeichert.

**Rechtsklick-Zauber**: schaltet den zweiten Zauber je Button ein und blendet die Spalte *Rechtsklick* neben der linken ein. Standardmäßig aus.

**N Buttons anzeigen**: wie viele der zehn Buttons tatsächlich erscheinen (0 bis 10). Belegte, aber ausgeblendete Buttons behalten ihre Zuordnung.

**Smart Healing / Sicherheitsaufschlag**: siehe [Die Buttons](#die-buttons). Standardmäßig aus; Aufschlag 0 bis 50 %, Standard 20.

### Reiter *Allgemein*

**Skalierung**: Skalierung der Plaketten von 0.6 bis 1.5. Wirkt nicht im Party-Frame-Modus.

**Button-Abstand**: Luft zwischen den Zauber-Buttons (und zwischen Plakette und erstem Button), 0 bis 20 px. Standard 2.

**Zeilen-Abstand**: senkrechter Abstand der Plaketten zueinander, 0 bis 20 px. Standard 4. Zusammen mit dem Button-Abstand lässt sich die ganze Anzeige damit deutlich kompakter schieben.

**Standard-Gruppenfenster**: statt eigener Plaketten hängen die Buttons an Blizzards Standard-Gruppenfenstern (`PartyMemberFrameN`); die Pet-Buttons an `PetFrame` bzw. `PartyMemberFrameNPetFrame`. Die eigenen Namensplaketten und Balken werden dabei ausgeblendet; die Heilvorhersage arbeitet unsichtbar weiter.

**Manabalken**: Manastreifen im Lebensbalken an/aus. Standardmäßig an.

**Begleiter anzeigen**: alle Pet-Plaketten an/aus. Standardmäßig an.

**Debuff-Icon**: Debuff-Icon mit Stackzahl neben dem Namen an/aus. Standardmäßig an.

**Sichtlinie**: Augen-Abzeichen für Einheiten außerhalb der Sichtlinie an/aus (siehe [Sichtlinie](#sichtlinie)). Standardmäßig an.

**Angegriffenen markieren**, **HoT- und Schild-Timer**, **Cooldowns auf den Buttons**, **Buff-Icons links am Balken**: die Anzeigen aus [Die Buttons](#die-buttons) und [Wer wird angegriffen](#wer-wird-angegriffen). Alle standardmäßig an.

**Linksklick auf Plakette / Rechtsklick auf Plakette**: was ein Klick auf eine Plakette tut: Anvisieren (Standard), Einheitenmenü, Anzeige verschieben, Nichts. Siehe [Klick auf eine Plakette](#klick-auf-eine-plakette).

**Testmodus**: füllt die Plätze 2 bis 10 mit Geisterspielern und -begleitern, damit du die Anzeige ohne Gruppe einrichten kannst (siehe [Testmodus](#testmodus)). Wird nicht gespeichert; nach dem Login immer aus.

**Klassenfarben**: färbt den Namen auf jeder Plakette in der Klassenfarbe (`RAID_CLASS_COLORS` des Clients, mit eingebauter Ersatztabelle). Begleiter behalten ihren hellblauen Namen. Standardmäßig an.

**Reichweiten-Fading**: blendet eine ganze Plakette samt Buttons auf 50 % ab (`FBRANGE\_ALPHA`), wenn die Einheit außer Reichweite ist. Geprüft wird alle halbe Sekunde (`FBRANGE\_INTERVAL`) per `IsSpellInRange` mit dem ersten belegten Button-Zauber; ohne belegten Zauber zählt `CheckInteractDistance(4)`, also 28 Meter. Standardmäßig an.

**Buff-Wache**: ein Knopf, der das Kaskadenmenü mit deinen Klassenbuffs öffnet (Seelenstärke, Göttlicher Willen, Mal der Wildnis, Segen, Dornen, Erdschild, …; nur gelernte erscheinen). Jede Plakette, deren Einheit diesen Buff **nicht** trägt, bekommt einen **orangen Rahmen**. Die Gruppenversion zählt mit (Gebet der Seelenstärke für Machtwort: Seelenstärke, Gabe der Wildnis für Mal der Wildnis, Große Segen für Segen), auch wenn ein anderer Heiler sie gewirkt hat: Die Prüfung vergleicht zuerst die Buff-Texturen mit deinen Zauberbuch-Icons und liest erst, wenn das nicht passt, die Buff-Namen per Tooltip-Scan. Geprüft wird bei `UNIT\_AURA` und nach jedem Gruppenwechsel, nichts läuft pro Frame. *Keine Buff-Wache* schaltet sie ab. Gespeichert als `WatchBuff`. Begleiter bleiben außen vor, solange *Buff-Wache auch für Begleiter* nicht gesetzt ist.

**Buff-Wache auch für Begleiter**: markiert auch Pets, denen der überwachte Buff fehlt. Standardmäßig aus.

**HealComm-Sync**: Austausch der Heilinformationen mit der Gruppe, siehe [HealComm-Sync](#healcomm-sync). Standardmäßig an.

**Sprache / Language**: schaltet zwischen Deutsch und Englisch um. Der Knopf öffnet dasselbe Kaskadenmenü wie die Zauberwahl. Die Umstellung wirkt **sofort**: `FBHealBox\_ApplyLocale()` beschriftet die bereits gebaute Oberfläche neu, ein `/reload` ist nicht nötig. Beim ersten Start entscheidet `GetLocale()`: deutsche Clients starten auf Deutsch, alle anderen auf Englisch. Die Wahl wird pro Charakter gespeichert.

**Fenster verschieben:** am Rahmen ziehen. Schließen über das X oben rechts, mit **Escape** oder per `/fbp config`. Escape wird über einen Hook auf `ToggleGameMenu` abgefangen (zusätzlich zu `UISpecialFrames`), damit es auch auf Clients funktioniert, die diese Liste nicht auswerten; ist Blizzards Spielmenü offen, schließt Escape wie gewohnt zuerst dieses.

## Testmodus

*Testmodus* in den Optionen anhaken oder `/fbp test` eingeben. Die eigene Plakette bleibt echt, jeder andere Platz wird mit einem Geist gefüllt: vier Spieler und drei Begleiter, damit das komplette Layout samt Pets unter ihren Besitzern zu sehen ist. Bist du gerade in einer echten Gruppe, ersetzen die Geister sie, solange der Testmodus an ist.

Die Geister sind so gebaut, dass jeder Anzeigezustand gleichzeitig zu sehen ist:

|Geist|Zeigt|
|-|-|
|Brynn|Krieger: **tot**, kein Manabalken, **fehlender Buff** (oranger Rahmen, sobald eine Buff-Wache gesetzt ist)|
|Cerys|Hexenmeister: Manabalken, einen **Absorb-Schild**-Anteil und das **Sichtlinien**-Abzeichen|
|Dorn|Jäger: wenig Leben (rot) mit **eingehender Heilung** dahinter|
|Elowen|Druide: einen **entfernbaren Debuff** (der Lebensbalken nimmt die Dispel-Farbe deiner Klasse an) und **außer Reichweite** (abgeblendet)|
|Fang, Zorbek, Bramble|Begleiter: ein Fokus-Pet ohne Manabalken, ein Mana-Pet mit, ein Pet mit eingehender Heilung und **Krankheits**-Debuff|

Ihre HP wandern langsam auf und ab, damit man die gelbe und rote Schwelle kommen und gehen sieht. Dorn trägt zusätzlich den roten Angriffsrahmen, Beispiel-Timer auf den Buttons 1 und 2 und **sechs Buff-Icons** mit unterschiedlicher Restzeit (eines ohne Uhr). Zauber-Buttons auf Geistern tun nichts außer einer kurzen Chatmeldung; Tooltips funktionieren. Die Geistertabelle heißt `FBTestGhosts` und steht am Dateianfang; Namen, Werte und Extras lassen sich frei ändern.

Der Testmodus ist für die eigenen Plaketten gedacht; im Party-Frame-Modus sitzen die Geister an Blizzards (ausgeblendeten) Frames und nützen wenig.

\---

## Das Zauber-Menü

Ein eigenes Kaskadenmenü, kein `UIDropDownMenu`: Dessen 1.12er Implementierung schließt Untermenüs, sobald die Maus einen Nachbareintrag streift, und erzwingt Haken und Klickgeräusch.

* **Ebene 1** listet alle gelernten Zauber deiner Klasse aus der Zauberliste, jeweils mit Icon.
* **Pfeil rechts** = mehrere Ränge vorhanden. Das Untermenü öffnet **beim Überfahren**, überlappt die Elternliste um zwei Pixel und hat ringsum eine Toleranzzone von 14 Pixeln, damit die Maus auf dem Weg nichts verliert.
* **Offen bleibt offen**: Nur die Auswahl eines Rangs, das Aufklappen eines anderen Untermenüs oder ein Klick daneben schließt es. Nach drei Sekunden ohne Maus in der Nähe greift eine Notbremse (`FBMENU\_GRACE\_TIME`, auf 999 setzen deaktiviert sie).
* **Kein Zauber** ganz oben leert den Button wieder.

Ausgewählt wird als Cast-String `Zauber(Rank N)`, genau die Form, die `CastSpellByName` erwartet, und die Basis dafür, dass die Vorhersage den exakten Rang kennt.

\---

## Heilvorhersage

Der Kern des Addons. Drei unabhängige Quellen speisen die Balken.

### Direktheilung

`SPELLCAST\_START` liefert Zaubernamen und Castdauer in Millisekunden, unabhängig davon, ob der Cast vom HealBox-Button, der Aktionsleiste oder aus einem Makro kommt. Es braucht dafür keinen Hook auf `CastSpellByName`. Die Vorschau verschwindet bei `SPELLCAST\_STOP`, `\_FAILED` und `\_INTERRUPTED`, Pushback (`SPELLCAST\_DELAYED`) verlängert sie.

Instants bekommen bewusst **keine** Vorhersage: Die Heilung ist da, bevor ein Balken sie zeigen könnte.

### Heilung über Zeit

`UnitBuff()` liefert für fremde Einheiten keine Restlaufzeit, das Addon führt deshalb selbst Buch:

1. Der Button meldet den Cast samt Ziel und Rang vor.
2. `UNIT\_AURA` bestätigt die Anwendung über den **Buff-Textur-Vergleich** mit dem Zauberbuch-Icon (locale-unabhängig, kein Tooltip-Scan pro Event).
3. Angezeigt wird `Restticks × Heilung pro Tick`, wobei die Restticks aus `(Ablauf − GetTime()) / Intervall` fallen. Der Balken zählt damit Tick für Tick herunter.
4. Fällt der Buff vorzeitig weg (Dispel, Tod, Überschrieben), ist die Anzeige sofort weg.

HoTs von der Aktionsleiste werden ebenfalls erkannt, dann mit dem höchsten bekannten Rang; der erste Combatlog-Tick zieht den Wert gerade.

Das Tickintervall ist in Vanilla nicht aus dem Tooltip lesbar und steht deshalb in `FBPredictTickInterval` (Standard 3 Sekunden, Lifebloom 1).

### Absorb-Schilde

Maximaler Absorb aus dem Zauberbuch-Tooltip, Verbrauch aus dem Combatlog (`(123 absorbed)`). Bei `\*\_VS\_SELF\_\*`-Events ist das Opfer der Spieler, sonst wird unter den aktuell beschildeten Namen gesucht.

Absorbierst du mehr, als der Tooltip hergibt (Heal-Gear), wird das Maximum **nach oben** korrigiert und gemerkt. Diese Korrektur ist einseitig und damit sicher: Mehr als möglich kann nicht absorbiert worden sein.

Vollständig absorbierte Treffer melden in Vanilla keine Zahl. Der Restwert bleibt dann stehen, bis der Buff fällt und die Anzeige gelöscht wird. Ebenso zählen Absorbs an Gruppenmitgliedern nur, soweit der Combatlog sie überhaupt zeigt; der Aura-Abgleich fängt die Abweichung am Ende wieder ein.

### Selbstkorrektur und Lernspeicher

Tooltips liefern in 1.12 nur Basiswerte **ohne** +Heilung, und eine API für Zaubermacht gibt es nicht. Der Combatlog liefert dagegen die Wahrheit:

|Beobachtung|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|`… gains 194 health from your Renew.`|Setzt die echte Heilung pro Tick für alle Restticks|
|`Your Flash Heal heals Bob for 1240.`|Pendelt die Schätzung ein (50/50-Mittelung)|
|`(342 absorbed)` über dem Maximum|Hebt den angenommenen Schildwert an|

Alles davon landet pro Zauber **und Rang** in `HealBox.PredictMemory` und übersteht den Logout.

Zwei Schutzregeln halten den Speicher sauber. **Crits werden nicht gelernt**: die Crit-Formulierung lässt den Zaubernamen als „Flash Heal critically" durchs Muster fallen, und der steht in keiner Watchlist. Und gelernt wird nur bei **gesichertem Rang**, also bei Casts über die HealBox-Buttons; sonst würde ein Rang-3-Cast von der Aktionsleiste dem Maximalrang zugeschrieben und die Vorhersage nach unten ziehen. Die laufende Anzeige korrigiert sich trotzdem immer, geschützt ist nur der dauerhafte Speicher.

Welcher Zauber was kann, entscheidet der Tooltip selbst; ein Zauber darf mehreres sein. Regrowth etwa liefert Sofortheilung *und* HoT und wird auch so behandelt.

## HealComm-Sync

HealComm-1.0 funkt reinen Klartext über `SendAddonMessage` mit dem Prefix `HealComm`. Heal Box Vanilla spricht dieses Protokoll direkt, ohne die Bibliothek einzubinden. Damit sehen Puppeteer, pfUI, Luna Unit Frames, CT\_RaidAssist und alles andere HealComm-fähige deine angekündigten Heilungen, und du siehst umgekehrt ihre.

|Nachricht|Bedeutung|
|-|-|
|`Heal/<Ziel>/<Betrag>/<Castzeit ms>/`|Direktheilung startet|
|`Healstop`|Cast abgebrochen|
|`Healdelay/<ms>/`|Pushback|
|`GrpHeal/<Betrag>/<ms>/<Z1>/<Z2>/…`|Gruppenheilung (Prayer of Healing)|
|`GrpHealstop` · `GrpHealdelay/<ms>/`|dito für Gruppenheilung|
|`Renew` · `Reju` · `Regr` `/<Ziel>/<Dauer>/`|HoT angewendet|

Gesendet wird ins Raid, sonst in die Gruppe, sonst gar nicht. Die Beträge sind die selbstkorrigierten Combatlog-Werte, also eher genauer als das, was ein echtes HealComm mit ItemBonusLib schätzt.

Ein paar Feinheiten: Bei erfolgreichem Castende geht **kein** `Healstop` raus; HealComm-Empfänger lassen den Eintrag selbst zur Castzeit auslaufen. Prayer of Healing geht korrekt als `GrpHeal` mit allen Zielen in Reichweite raus. Und ein HoT von der Aktionsleiste wird beim ersten eigenen Combatlog-Tick nachgemeldet, mit der dann noch verbleibenden Laufzeit, denn erst „… from **your** Renew" beweist, dass er von dir stammt.

Beim Empfang werden eigene Nachrichten über den Absendernamen gefiltert, und da HealComm eingehende Heilungen pro Caster ablegt, kann sich nichts doppeln, selbst wenn parallel noch ein echtes HealComm mitfunkt. HoT-Nachrichten tragen nur Laufzeiten und keine Beträge; HealComm zählt sie im eigenen `getHeal` nicht mit, hier passiert dasselbe.

**Absorb-Schilde kennt das Protokoll nicht**: die bleiben lokal.

## Slash-Befehle

|Befehl|Wirkung|
|-|-|
|`/fbp`|Statusbericht: alle ausgelesenen Tooltip-Werte je Zauber (Direkt-, HoT- und Schildanteil, gelernte Werte in Klammern), alle gerade laufenden Vorhersagen, der Zustand des HealComm-Sync und die empfangenen Fremdheilungen|
|`/fbp debug`|Live-Ausgabe an/aus. Meldet jeden erkannten Cast, jede Korrektur, jeden Absorb und jede gefunkte Nachricht (`\[FBP>]`)|
|`/fbp reset`|Verwirft alle gelernten Werte und liest die Tooltips neu ein|
|`/fbp test`|Testmodus an/aus (wie der Haken in den Optionen)|
|`/fbp config`|Optionsfenster auf/zu (wie der Minimap-Button)|
|`/fbp buffs`|Listet die verfolgten Buff-Zauber, ihre Präsenz und Restzeit auf dir sowie deine rohen Buff-Texturen|
|`/fbp raid`|Raidmodus an/aus|
|`/fbp raidtest 20` · `40` · `off`|Raid-Test mit 20 oder 40 Geistern, oder aus|
|`/fbp ticker`|Mana-Ticker an/aus|
|`/fbp damage`|Smart Damage an/aus|

`/fbp` ist die erste Anlaufstelle, wenn etwas nicht angezeigt wird: Steht ein Zauber dort nicht drin, hat der Tooltip-Parser ihn nicht erkannt und nicht die Anzeige versagt.

Fehlende Schlüssel, etwa in einer alten `HealBox`-Tabelle aus 1.4, zieht `FBHealBox\_ApplyDefaults()` beim Laden nach. Der Testmodus wird bewusst **nicht** gespeichert.

### Einheiten und Testmodus

Die Anzeige ruft `UnitExists`, `UnitName`, `UnitHealth` und `UnitMana` nie direkt auf, sondern geht über diese Wrapper. Im Testmodus antworten sie aus `FBTestGhosts`, sonst aus der echten API:

|Funktion|Liefert|
|-|-|
|`FBUnitExists(unit)`|true / false|
|`FBUnitName(unit)`|Name|
|`FBUnitHealth(unit)`|`hp, hpMax` (hpMax ist nie 0)|

|`FBMenu\_CloseAll()` · `FBMenu\_IsOpen()`|Menü schließen, Zustand abfragen|

### Vorhersage: Abfrage

Die vier Funktionen, die die Balken speisen. Alle erwarten einen **Spielernamen**, keine Unit-ID:

|Funktion|Liefert|
|-|-|
|`FBGetDirectHeal(name)`|Betrag des laufenden eigenen Direktcasts|
|`FBGetHoTHeal(name)`|Summe aller noch ausstehenden eigenen HoT-Ticks|
|`FBGetShield(name)`|Verbleibender Absorb|
|`FBGetCommHeal(name)`|Angekündigte Heilung anderer Heiler|

### Vorhersage: Innenleben

|`FBComm\_SendHealStart(…)`|`Heal` bzw. `GrpHeal`|
|`FBComm\_SendHealStop()` · `FBComm\_SendHealDelay(ms)`|Abbruch und Pushback|

\---

## Fehlersuche

**Ein Zauber taucht im Menü nicht auf.** Er steht nicht in der Zauberliste deiner Klasse (`Spell.Name` am Dateianfang) oder ist noch nicht gelernt. Die Liste lässt sich frei erweitern.

**Gelernte Absorb-Werte sind gedeckelt.** Ein gemerkter Absorb über dem 1,5-fachen des Tooltipwerts gilt als Zählfehler und wird beim Laden verworfen (`FBPredict\_SanitizeMemory`); die durch die alte Doppelladung verdoppelten Werte aus Versionen vor 1.4.2 räumen sich so von selbst auf.

**Keine Vorhersage für einen bestimmten Zauber.** `/fbp` aufrufen: Steht der Zauber nicht in der Liste der ausgelesenen Zauber, hat der Tooltip-Parser ihn nicht erkannt. Auf abweichenden Servern können die Formulierungen abweichen; die Muster sitzen gebündelt in `FBPredict\_GetSpellInfo`.

**Combatlog-Korrekturen greifen nicht.** Die Muster werden aus den GlobalStrings des Clients gebaut (`PERIODICAURAHEALOTHERSELF`, `HEALEDSELFOTHER`, `ABSORB\_TRAILER`) und fallen sonst auf englische Vorgaben zurück. `/fbp debug` zeigt, ob Korrekturen ankommen.

**Werte sind zu niedrig.** Vor der ersten beobachteten Heilung steht nur der Tooltip-Basiswert ohne +Heilung zur Verfügung. Ein einziger Cast über die Buttons genügt zum Einpendeln.

**Der HealComm-Sync scheint tot.** Er sendet nur in Gruppe oder Raid; allein passiert nichts. `/fbp` zeigt den Schaltzustand, `/fbp debug` jede ausgehende Nachricht.

**Nach einem Gear-Wechsel stimmen die Zahlen nicht.** Sie korrigieren sich beim nächsten Cast von selbst; `/fbp reset` erzwingt den Neustart.

\---

## Klassenzauber

Die vorbelegten Listen, frei erweiterbar in `Spell.Name`:

|Klasse|Zauber|
|-|-|
|Priester|Renew · Flash Heal · Lesser Heal · Heal · Greater Heal · Binding Heal · Prayer of Healing · Prayer of Mending · Circle of Healing · Power Word: Shield · Abolish Disease · Cure Disease · Dispel Magic · Power Word: Fortitude · Prayer of Fortitude · Divine Spirit · Prayer of Spirit · Shadow Protection · Prayer of Shadow Protection · Fear Ward · Power Infusion · Resurrection|
|Druide|Healing Touch · Regrowth · Rejuvenation · Swiftmend · Tranquility · Lifebloom · Abolish Poison · Cure Poison · Remove Curse · Mark of the Wild · Gift of the Wild · Thorns · Innervate · Rebirth|

|Paladin|Flash of Light · Holy Light · Holy Shock · Lay on Hands · Cleanse · Purify · Blessing of Protection · Blessing of Freedom · Blessing of Sacrifice · Redemption · Divine Intervention · Blessing of Wisdom / Might / Kings / Salvation / Light / Sanctuary · Greater Blessing of Wisdom / Might / Kings / Salvation / Light / Sanctuary|
|Magier|Remove Lesser Curse · Arcane Intellect · Arcane Brilliance · Dampen Magic · Amplify Magic|
|Hexenmeister|Unending Breath · Detect Invisibility · Detect Lesser / Greater Invisibility|

Nicht vorhandene Einträge stören nicht: Findet der Zauberbuch-Scan sie nicht, werden sie stillschweigend übergangen.

## Credits

**Original: Heal Box von Dourd** (Argent Dawn EU), UI Overhauled. Von ihm stammen die Grundidee, der Aufbau mit Namensplaketten und Schnellzugriff-Buttons und das ursprüngliche Optionsfenster. Ohne diese Vorlage gäbe es dieses Addon nicht. Ehre wem Ehre gebührt.

**Vanilla-Portierung und Funktionserweiterung 09/2026: Mquadrat.** Portiert auf Client 1.12.1 mit optionaler SuperWoW-Unterstützung, dazu:

* eigenes Kaskadenmenü für Zauber- und Rangwahl, weil `UIDropDownMenu` in 1.12 keine brauchbaren Untermenüs liefert
* Heilvorhersage für Direktheilung, HoT-Restticks und Absorb-Schilde, selbstkorrigierend über den Combatlog
* HealComm-Sync mit Puppeteer, pfUI, Luna und Co., ohne Ace-Bibliotheken
* Lokalisierung Deutsch, Englisch, Spanisch, Französisch und Italienisch, im laufenden Spiel umschaltbar
* 1.4.4.1: Buff-Erkennung & Tooltip-Scan behoben (Göttlicher Willen Uhr-Icon), vollständige Klassen-Zauberlisten mit Segen, Buffs, Hilfszaubern und Wiederbelebung, Gruppen-Buff-Erkennung; siehe CHANGELOG
* 1.4.4: Leistungsdurchgang ohne Funktionsänderung (zentrale Button-Zustände, Anzeige-Zwischenspeicher, gemeinsame Aura-Scans, zusammengefasste Event-Salven); siehe CHANGELOG
* 1.4.3: Mana-Ticker-Modul (2-s-Regenerationstick und Fünf-Sekunden-Regel als Funke im Manabalken), Smart-Damage-Modul (Rangwahl für Angriffszauber auf jeder Aktionsleiste), Smart Healing (automatisches Abrangen, standardmäßig aus), Cooldown-Uhr auf den Buttons, roter Rahmen für den Angegriffenen, HoT/Schild-Timer auf den Buttons
* 1.4.2: Raidmodus als eigenes Modul (`FBHealBox_Raid.lua`) mit kompaktem 20/40-Raster, Mini-Buttons, eigenem Options-Reiter und Raid-Test; Hook-Schnittstelle im Kern
* 1.4.1: Begleiter-Plaketten, Manabalken im Lebensbalken, einstellbare Button- und Zeilenabstände, Testmodus mit Geisterspielern, gespeicherte Plattenposition, Klassenfarben, Buff-Wache, Reichweiten-Fading, Optionen in Reitern, Rechtsklick-Zauber, Tot/Geist/Offline-Text, Debuff-Icon. Siehe CHANGELOG.md.
